Hi Guys!!! I finally managed to make my first website and also the portfolio. This is my first post,and I am student in Ananda College. I am participating to Ananda College ICT Society's task based intra-school software competition held for the third consective year for the very first time and I'm also a <B> Google Code-in 2019 Finalist </B> under BRL-CAD organization. And it's not too hard to make a website but I am really happy. I love coding lots of lots of codes and I am a open source contributor in BRL-CAD, an open source 3D modelling software. So, that's little about me I will come in a new post soon. Happy Coding!!! :)
